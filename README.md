# Quilted Create

Quilted Create is a small 1.19.2 modpack focused around [create](https://modrinth.com/mod/create-fabric). It utilizes my personal preferences of mods. There is no questing or linear progression as of the moment. Meant to be more sandbox.

**This modpack is not made for people who are not already familiar with create.**

## Building

This modpack utliizes [packwiz](https://github.com/packwiz/packwiz). 

To build the modpack, assuming packwiz is installed:

1. Clone this repository - `git clone https://github.com/kitgxrl/quilted-create`
2. Change directories - `cd quilted-create` (can be different from system to system)
3. Run `packwiz modrinth export`
4. Done!
